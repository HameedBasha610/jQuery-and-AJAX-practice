# jQuery API Methods Practice
This repository contains practice implementations of jQuery's LOAD, GET, and POST methods using various APIs. It demonstrates how to interact with external data sources effectively using jQuery.

## Note
* I have used a fake API generator **Reqres(https://reqres.in/)** for practice purposes and the POST method doesn't change the existing data on the API.
* Remember to add the jQuery link in your header
* I have used script defer to load the script only after the HTML formatting is done. You can alternatively use $(document).ready.
### Reference

 The implementation has been referred from **w3Schools** (https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/). Refer to the site in case of doubts.
